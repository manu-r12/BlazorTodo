First Blazor App
I'm learning Blazor because I love exploring new tech, and Blazor caught my attention. It lets you build web apps using C# instead of JavaScript. I wanted to try something different and see how it compares to other frameworks like React.

What I Learned:
Component-based: Like React, Blazor uses components to handle UI and logic together.
Data Binding: Blazor’s two-way data binding is similar to React’s state management.
Lifecycle: Blazor components have lifecycle methods like React (e.g., OnInitialized is like componentDidMount).
Client-side vs. Server-side: Blazor can run entirely in the browser (WebAssembly) or rely on the server (Blazor Server).
